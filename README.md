## Description
Demonstrates using the Anaplan REST API with OAuth with device-based authorization. The code highlights how to generate a `device_id`, `access_token`, and `refresh_token`. Additionally, the code highlights a multi-threaded approach to request a new `access_token` while performing other longer running operations such as a large data load. Please note that with this code example, the concept is simulated by calling ***Get Workspaces*** multiple times.

## Deployment
1. Fork and clone project repo
2. Using `pip install`, download and install the following Python libraries
`sys`, 
`logging`, 
`threading`, 
`requests`,
`json`,
`time`,
`pyjwt`, and
`apsw`
3. Create a device authorization code grant (known as a device grant in Anaplan). More information is available [here](https://help.anaplan.com/2ef7b883-fe87-4194-b028-ef6e7bbf8e31-OAuth2-API). 



## Features
- Dynamically creates a new `access_token` using a `refresh_token` on an independent worker thread.
- Secure storage of tokens

## Usage

1. When executing the first time on a particular device, open the CLI in the project folder and run `python3 anaplan.py -r -c <<enter Client ID>>` 

2. After the above step, the script can be executed unattended by simply executing `python3 anaplan.py`

Note: The `client_id` and `refresh_token` are stored as encrypted values in a SQLite database. As an alternative, a solution like [auth0](https://auth0.com/) would further enhance security. 

## Tests
Currently, no automated unit tests have been built.
